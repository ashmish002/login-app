# login-app
This a a java web application,i have developed just for my learning and practicing purpose.
This application has a login page, which asks to fill the basic details like name, password, email id and after accepting terms and condition the data will be securily added to database.
it runs on Apache Tomacat server.
the servlet is created using HttpServlet method,and using welcome file tag to open home.html page rather than index.htlm page
and using forward()and include()method to add the response of other servlet.
